// Lexicographic order
Z1:cartesian < Z2:cartesian as boolean is
    Z1.Re < Z2.Re or (Z1.Re=Z2.Re and Z1.Im < Z2.Im)

// Useful for implementation of containers that require it
Map : map[complex, text]

// Not compatible with multiplication
A is 2 + 5 i
B is 8 - i
Z is 0 + 0 i
X is 1 - 2 i

// The following is true
A < B and Z < X and not (A*Z < B*X)
